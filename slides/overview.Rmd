# State of R in USAF

## Certification of R Suite 1.0

- AFSPC certified a collection of tools known as `R Suite 1.0`

    + R (v3.2.5)

    + RStudio IDE (v0.98.1105)

    + JAGS - Just Another Gibbs Sampler (v3.4)

- Several arrangements were made to certify R 

    + Establishment of an R 'Program Office' to distribute software and track installations

    + 

## `R Suite 2.0`

- AFIT DSL is working with Mr. Hutto & AFSPC to certify an updated collection of tools

    + R (v3.3.3)

    + RStudio IDE (v1.0.136)

    + JAGS (v4.2)

    + Rtools (maybe)

- Each base has its own approval process

- Organizations may add another layer

# Admin Stuff
- discuss admin stuff (location of bathrooms, lunch)
-- Set ground rules (asking questions -- help each other!!, internet usage, power access)
-- Ensure everyone is set to go
